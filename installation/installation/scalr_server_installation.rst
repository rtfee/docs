Scalr Server Install Guide
==========================
Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Scalrâ€™s architecture consist of 7 modules (Proxy, App, Session, RabbitMQ, Worker, InfluxDB, Main DB, and Cost Analytics DB).  The recommended Scalr HA deployment consists of 6 VMs (Instances) and is outlined in the following diagram:

It is completely acceptable to group multiple components onto one virtual machine as the load for these services are minimal. The following are the recommended specs for the initial configuration:

- Load Balancer of choice. The target should be the Scalr servers over 80 or 443 and 5671.

- 1 VM for the Worker: 4CPU, 8GB RAM ,100GB storage mounted on /opt/scalr-server on each server.
NOTE: Worker should only be enabled on one server.

- 1 VM for InfluxDB:
4CPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB storage mounted on /opt/scalr-server on each server

- 2 VMs for Proxy, Sessions, and App:
4CPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB storage mounted on /opt/scalr-server on each server

- 2 VMs for DB (active/passive):
4CPU, 8GB RAM, 750GB storage mounted on /opt/scalr-server on each server
