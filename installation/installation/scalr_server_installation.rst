Scalr Server Install Guide
==========================
Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Scalrâ€™s architecture consist of 7 modules (Proxy, App, Session, RabbitMQ, Worker, InfluxDB, Main DB, and Cost Analytics DB).  The recommended Scalr HA deployment consists of 6 VMs (Instances) and is outlined in the following diagram:

It is completely acceptable to group multiple components onto one virtual machine as the load for these services are minimal. The following are the recommended specs for the initial configuration:

* Load Balancer of choice. The target should be the Scalr servers over 80 or 443 and 5671.
* 1 VM for the Worker:

  * 4CPU, 8GB RAM
  * 100GB storage mounted on /opt/scalr-server on each server
  * NOTE: Worker should only be enabled on one server.

* 1 VM for InfluxDB:

  * 4CPU, 16GB RAM
  * 100GB storage mounted on /opt/scalr-server on each server

* 2 VMs for Proxy, Sessions, and App:

  * 4CPU, 8GB RAM
  * 100GB storage mounted on /opt/scalr-server on each server

* 2 VMs for DB (active/passive):

  * 4CPU, 8GB RAM
  * 750GB storage mounted on /opt/scalr-server on each server

Supported Operating Systems: 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.x or 7.x
* Centos Linux 6.x or 7.x
* Debian 7.x or 8.x
* Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04
